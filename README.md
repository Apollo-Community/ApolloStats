Readme:

- Change the colors used in css.

Database:
- Timeout and show error when we can't connect to the ext. db.

Account items:
- Would be nice to show why a player got an item too.

Heat maps:
- Really nice if we could show a heatmap of deaths.
- Ask @HiddenKn how he made his python version.

Game map:
- Huge, zoomable map of the main station (only).
- Store the map as picture tiles?
