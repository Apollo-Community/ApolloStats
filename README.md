ApolloStats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Webpage for showing various stats from the Apollo Station SS13 game database.
With heavy inspiration from other servers' webpages such as [Goon](http://goonhub.com/) and [/vg/station](http://ss13.pomf.se/index.php/bans).

TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Templates:
- Show some nice error pages.
- Use existing assets from the forum, such as css and logos.
- Replace links for tmp static assets with ext. assets to forum server.

Account items:
- Would be nice to show why a player got an item too.

Heat maps:
- Really nice if we could show a heatmap of deaths.
- Ask @HiddenKn how he made his python version.

Game map:
- Huge, zoomable map of the main station (only).
- Store the map as picture tiles?
- Investigate how goon made their map.
- Need to rebuild the map after any new map changes from a commit.
